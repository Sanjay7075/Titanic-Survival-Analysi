"My 30-day Data Analysis Journey - Day 1: Titanic Survival Analysis"
#What I Learned from Titanic Survival Analysis
##1️⃣ Data Cleaning is Important

The dataset had missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns.
I learned how to fill missing values using median and mode.
##2️⃣ Visualization Helps in Finding Insights

Bar charts helped me understand the survival rate by gender and class.
Seaborn plots made it easy to see patterns in the data.
##3️⃣ Key Insights from the Data

Women had a higher survival rate than men.
First-class passengers had a better chance of survival than lower classes.
More men from lower classes didn’t survive due to limited access to lifeboats.
